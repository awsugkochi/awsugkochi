<h4> Agenda for talk </h4>
<br>
<h4> Creating Digital Human using AWS Sumerian and Cognitive Services </h4>
<br>

- One of the most important aspects of science fiction, is to help humans converse (both bi-directional) with computers in a very natural way. Science fiction authors always have a distant dream about this, in which humans talk to  ‘intelligent computers’, which can hear and understand what the human spoke, intelligent to learn and respond in a very natural way by using both verbal and non-verbal cues, just like a fellow human

- Now we are undergoing a pivotal moment in the history of mankind were, science fiction is becoming a scientific fact by advancements in multitudes of technologies. These advancements are going to radically transform our lives in an unimaginable way.

- One such instance is, ‘Digital Human’ - Digital Human possesses the intelligence, such that they can see, hear, converse & show gestures. Digital Human enables us to interact with computers in a more natural way, as we converse with fellow humans. They give real ‘human touch’ to technology.

- In this talk, we will give an overview of ‘The Digital Human’ and how we can use AWS Sumerian & Cognitive Services to create it.
