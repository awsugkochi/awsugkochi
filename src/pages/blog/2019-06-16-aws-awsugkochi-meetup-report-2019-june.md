<br> 

This time our topic was `AWS EC2 Spot Instances - Save 90% on your EC2 costs` and the session was taken by [Chakravarthy Nagarajan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chakravarthy-nagarajan-7653311a/), Solution Architect - EC2 Spot Specialist at Amazon Internet Services Private Limited (AWS)


Amazon EC2 Spot instances offer spare compute capacity availavle in the AWS cloud at steep discounts compared to On-Demand instances. Spot instances enable you to optimize your costs on the AWS cloud and scale your application's throughput up to 10X for the same budget.

## Notes 

<br>

#### Spot Instances

Amazon EC2 Spot Instances let you take advantage of unused EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud. Spot Instances are available at up to a 90% discount compared to On-Demand prices. You can use Spot Instances for various stateless, fault-tolerant, or flexible applications such as big data, containerized workloads, CI/CD, web servers, high-performance computing (HPC), and other test & development workloads.

<br>

#### Spot Instances - Pricing

With Spot instances, You pay the Spot price that's in effect for the time period your instances are running. Spot instance prices are set by Amazon EC2 and adjust gradually based on long-term trends in supply and demand for Spot instance capacity.

Spot instances are available at a discount of up to 90% off compared to On-Demand pricing. To compare the current Spot prices against standard On-Demand rates, visit the Spot Instance Advisor.

<br>

#### Best Practices

*Spot Rules*

Learn two simple rules to follow to maximize compute cost savings

  1. Spot Capacity Pools have separate prices and change infrequently
  2. Amazon EC2 will give you a 2 minute warning when we need the capacity back

*Instance Flexibility*

Test your application on different instance types when possible. Because prices fluctuate independently for each instance type in an Availability Zone, you can often get more compute capacity for the same price when you have instance type flexibility

*Fleet API*

EC2 Fleet simplifies the provisioning of EC2 capacity across different instance types, AZs, and across On-Demand, RIs and Spot purchase models. The same functionality is available in Spot Fleet.

<br>

#### Handling interruptions

Spot Instances receive a two-minute notice when these instances are about to be reclaimed by EC2, because EC2 needs the capacity back. Use Cloudwatch Events to get notfification when the Spot instances are interrupted by Amazon EC2. Also review the Spot Instance Advisor for average frequency of interruption for different Spot Pools.
