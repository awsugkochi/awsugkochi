AWS Hackathon for Good organized by AWS User Group Kochi in partnership with IBS Software and Intuit has concluded and the winners are announced.

The first prize goes to `Amal Das NP` and `Akhil Rajan` who created an application RapidSupportDesk which could be helpful for the society to handle disaster and other major disruptions. This application uses Amazon Connect and Amazon Lex for recording Incoming calls and routing requests to support teams. The application will follow up with the reporters with automatic questions and store the records in S3 buckets for the records.

Students and Developer community members from all over Kerala participated in the event to make it a big success.
