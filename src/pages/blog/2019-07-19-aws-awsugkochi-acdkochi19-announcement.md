<h3> AWS Community Day - Kochi </h3>

<br> 

- The AWS Community Day is supported by AWS but independent of them. It will provide the community with a platform to have a 'collective voice': an opportunity to explore what we love about AWS, but also what we'd like to see improved.

- Talks featured technical discussions led by expert AWS users and community leaders from around the world.

- Community-based learning is the best way to enhance the concepts being taught by connecting with enthusiasts in person, thereby sharing first-hand experiences and familiar, accessible examples.

- All skills levels are welcome to help accomplish our motto of learning, sharing and networking. Let us join hands to empower this tech community to make it bigger and better!

- Expected attendees: 350 - 500 people ranging from Developers, DevOps Engineers, Solution Architects, Consultants, CTO/VP, Platform Engineers, AWS Evangelists
